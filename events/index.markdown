Free Friday
-----------------
*Next Free Friday is September 9th, 2016*

Come to Athensworks for Free Friday and experience coworking with some of the friendliest, creative, and tech savvy people in Athens. We'll make sure you get a desk space, access to wi-fi plus coffee or tea and some local treats. We also have normal office amenities like a whiteboard, printer, conference room, kitchenette and a phonebooth for taking calls. This is a chance to break the monotony of your usual work space and enjoy a refreshing change of environment to spark your creativity and boost your productivity.

So grab your laptop, invite a friend to come with you, and see what coworking is all about!

Hack Night
----------
Third Thursday of every month, starting at 7 pm

We host a hack night every month. **What's a hack night, you ask?** Programmers, designers, and creatives of all shapes, sizes, ages, and skill levels come together to tackle a project.  There isn't a plan until we get there.  We provide some food, drinks and an open space.  You bring ideas, computers, and a willingness to ship something real that night.

We’re currently looking for a sponsor for this event.  If you’d be interested in sponsoring it, please contact us at the address below.

Everything Local
-------------------
*Next Date TBD*

We are hosting a public showcase of projects by local artists, entrepreneurs, crafters, students, researchers, and DIY enthusiasts. We'd like to invite you to attend a night of brief project presentations, mingling, and hors d'oeuvres at Central Venue, right behind Athensworks.
