Everything Local
----------------
*Saturday, September 9, 2017 at 1:30p*

We are hosting a public showcase of projects by local artists, entrepreneurs, crafters, students, researchers, and DIY enthusiasts. We'd like to invite you to attend an afternoon of brief project presentations, mingling, and hors d'oeuvres at Central Venue, right behind Athensworks.

Questions? Contact [everythinglocal@athensworks.com](mailto:everythinglocal@athensworks.com)


Hack Night
----------
*Third Thursday of every month at 7p*

We host a hack night every month. **What's a hack night, you ask?** Programmers, designers, and creatives of all shapes, sizes, ages, and skill levels come together to tackle a project.  There isn't a plan until we get there.  We provide some food, drinks and an open space.  You bring ideas, computers, and a willingness to ship something real that night.

We’re currently looking for a sponsor for this event.  If you’d be interested in sponsoring it, please contact us at the address below.

Free Friday
-----------
*Next Free Friday not yet scheduled*

Come to Athensworks for Free Friday and experience coworking with some of the friendliest, creative, and tech savvy people in Athens. We'll make sure you get a desk space, access to wi-fi plus coffee or tea and some local treats. We also have normal office amenities like a whiteboard, printer, conference room, kitchenette and a phonebooth for taking calls. This is a chance to break the monotony of your usual work space and enjoy a refreshing change of environment to spark your creativity and boost your productivity.

So grab your laptop, invite a friend to come with you, and see what coworking is all about!
