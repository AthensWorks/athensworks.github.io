Hack Night
----------
~~Third Thursday of every month, starting at 7 pm~~
For the month of October, we're having a special Hack Night at Create Space, on Ohio University's campus.  This event will be on October 24th at 7 pm. See the [facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/578684955527258/?ref=22) for more details.

We host a hack night every month. **What's a hack night, you ask?** Programmers, designers, and creatives of all shapes, sizes, ages, and skill levels come together to tackle a project.  There isn't a plan until we get there.  We provide some food, drinks and an open space.  You bring ideas, computers, and a willingness to ship something real that night.

We’re currently looking for a sponsor for this event.  If you’d be interested in sponsoring it, please contact us at the address below.

Everything Local
-------------------
*November 22nd*

We are hosting a public showcase of projects by local artists, entrepreneurs, crafters, students, researchers, and DIY enthusiasts. We'd like to invite you to attend a night of brief project presentations, mingling, and hors d'oeuvres at Central Venue, right behind Athensworks.
