Hack Night
----------
*Second Friday of every month*

We host a hack night every month. **What's a hack night, you ask?** Programmers of all shapes, sizes, ages, and skill levels come together to tackle a project.  There isn't a plan until we get there.  We provide some food, drinks and an open space.  You bring ideas, computers, and a willingness to ship something real that night.
