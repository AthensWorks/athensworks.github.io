Everything Local
-------------------
*Friday, March 22 from 6 to 8 PM*

We are hosting a public showcase of projects by local artists, entrepreneurs, crafters, students, researchers, and DIY enthusiasts. We'd like to invite you to attend a night of brief project presentations, mingling, and hors d'oeuvres at Central Venue, right behind Athensworks.

Are you working on a project that you would like to present? [Please Apply](https://docs.google.com/a/rickychilcott.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dElRVVg1SmpMSGliOUhNTVQ2cG5FR3c6MQ)

Hack Night
----------
*Third Thursday of every month, starting at 7 pm*

We host a hack night every month. **What's a hack night, you ask?** Programmers, designers, and creatives of all shapes, sizes, ages, and skill levels come together to tackle a project.  There isn't a plan until we get there.  We provide some food, drinks and an open space.  You bring ideas, computers, and a willingness to ship something real that night.
