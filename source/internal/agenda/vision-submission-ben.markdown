Hi. This is Athensworks.

We’re a local coworking community.  We aim to support and challenge our members.  

What does this mean? It means we have a focused workspace where you can come and accomplish your work. In this space we strive to enable our members to collaborate with each other and take advantage of the many different skills and talents present in a social and natural manner. In this way we hope to aid our individual members, the coworking community and local business environment in growing to be more [skilled/competitive/successful/craft-concious/wtf].

Who are we? We are individual professionals. Artists. Developers. Creatives. Writers. Academics. Designers. Programmers. This doesn’t cover what you do?  That’s great! Our community thrives on diversity and the intrinsic collaboration and challenges that diversity brings—that’s why we have programmers and dancers, writers and videographers in the community.
