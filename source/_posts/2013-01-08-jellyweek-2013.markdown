We are gearing up for what is to be a great [JELLYWEEK 2013](http://jellyweek.tumblr.com/). We will be participating with what will likely be over two hundred of other groups of jelliers (is that a word?) and making history in the process.  <!-- more -->This is the first worldwide JELLYWEEK that we are taking part under the guise of Athensworks and certainly in our new space, but not the first for our group.

Facebook tells me that the [Athens Ohio Coworking](https://www.facebook.com/groups/304520699579540/?fref=ts) group was started a little over a year ago and from that group came Athensworks.  We have been in "The Den" for a few months and we're looking to show off our new digs.  JELLYWEEK 2013 is a great way to check out our coworking space in person, grab a desk, and spend some time jellying.

We will have the space open for free 10 AM to 3 pm Monday, January 14th through Friday, January 20th. Come say "Hi" or get some work done.  We'd love to meet you.
