<h2>Where are we?</h2>
We’re located in uptown Athens, Ohio. Just turn right at the end of Court Street, and you’ll find us not a block later at 29 East Carpenter Street. Look for the glass storefront.

<h2>Who works here?</h2>
Much of our interest is currently from folks in technology, media, and academia, but we are glad to have as much diversity as we can find seats for. <a href="/membership/members">Meet the members</a>.

<h2>Who is welcome?</h2>
If you can do your work at a desk or in an open space, we welcome you to check us out. Part of the fun of a coworking space is working with people who do something radically different from you!
