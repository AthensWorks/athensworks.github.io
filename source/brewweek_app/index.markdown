Athensworks, in partnership with [Ohio Brew Week](http://OhioBrewWeek.com), built an app for Ohio Brew Week 2015. All work was done by a group of volunteers and members of Athensworks in the context of a monthly event we call Hack Night. If you’re interested in Hack Night, checkout our [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/Athensworks). If you’re interested in a membership, we’d love to have you join Athensworks, just give us a shout!

All the code that went into the app is open source and can be found at:

* <https://github.com/AthensWorks/OBWapp-iOS>
* <https://github.com/AthensWorks/OBWapp-API>
* <https://github.com/AthensWorks/OBWapp-Admin-UI>

*Unfortunately, we don't have an Android or Web application this year, but we hope to in the future. If you see any of the developers or designers at Brew Week, buy them a beer and maybe next year they'll add more features and platforms.*
