###Athensworks Meeting Notes 04.17.13

* Hack Night – Joe’s on the ready to handle the ins and outs of Hack Night tomorrow from open to lock up, pizza to soda. He’s all over it. Way to go, Joe!
* Logo – Joe’s brief looks good aside from a couple of typos that he’s prepared to edit and circulate to us all as a brief in pdf format. We’ll all circulate this brief to our friends and design colleagues. Deadline for submissions is Monday May 20th. We’ll discuss designs at our meeting on the 22nd.
* Visioning Discussion – We’re still looking for a brief from Ben with regards to the combined vision statements. We’ll work on this next week.
